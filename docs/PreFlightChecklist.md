# Pre-flight Checklist

Make sure you tick all the check boxes before you begin you CD Journey ðŸš€

- [ ] **A Version Control System account**  - In this guide weâ€™re going to use GitHub. Our example appâ€™s source is on GitHub and youâ€™ll need to fork those repos, so make sure you have a GitHub account. Alternatively, if youâ€™re comfortable following your inner-shoulder-angelâ€™s guide to converting GitHub instructions you can use your own VCS. This, however, is an exercise for the reader. 

- [ ] **A Docker Hub account** - Harness helps you publish container images virtually anywhere. For this guide weâ€™ll use Docker Hub.

- [ ] **Kubernetes cluster** - Your k8s cluster can run anywhere, so long as it has access to the internet. Later on youâ€™ll create a â€˜demoâ€™ namespace. (yeah, naming things is still hard) Make sure that namespace is free. (Or you can JIT Translate in your head) ***Note**, you need to be able to execute kubectl commands on your cluster, so make sure youâ€™ve authenticated.*
