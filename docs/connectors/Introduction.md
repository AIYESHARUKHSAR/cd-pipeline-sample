# Connector Introduction

Yep, Connectors… connect to things.  
I swear we don’t pay our naming team enough. In this case we use connectors to link to **Docker Hub**, **GitHub**, and your **Kubernetes cluster**.   
You may be thinking, Wait! We just created a secret for these… And you’re right. Connectors use secrets, which is why we had you set those up first. Like we did for secrets, let’s walk through the first one, because it has a bit of a twist. After that you’ll have the opportunity to fly like a bird, or walk with me through the rest! Ready? Here we go!
